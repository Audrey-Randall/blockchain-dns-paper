Malware that is distributed across multiple machines needs a way to distribute 
commands, upload stolen 
data, and coordinate between infected hosts. Most malware, such as botnets or 
ransomware, uses a 
central command and control (C2) server for this task. However, as a single 
point of failure, a 
central C2 server presents an obvious weak link for defenders to 
target~\cite{kesari_deterring_2017}. 
Malware authors must therefore be able to easily relocate and replace a C2 
server after a defender 
takedown. All previously infected hosts must be able to find the new server at 
its new address, 
without outside coordination --- if they cannot, they become useless. Malware 
authors avoid 
this ``sunk cost'' problem by providing a layer of indirection --- a naming 
layer --- instead of 
hard-coding a fixed C2 server address directly into deployed malware. This 
naming layer must be 
resilient to takedown efforts.

Until recently, the naming layer used most frequently by malware was ordinary 
DNS, which is rarely 
blocked at the protocol level, universally supported, and easy to configure. 
Malware authors use 
various strategies, such as fast flux or DGAs (domain generation algorithms), 
to cycle through domains 
or the IP addresses they resolve to and complicate defense efforts. However, 
DNS domains are subject 
to central authorities, who may be compelled to seize or deny access to abused 
domains. Malware 
authors have recently come up with an innovative solution to this risk: they 
have started to use 
\emph{decentralized naming systems}, in particular naming systems built on 
blockchains. 

Decentralized naming systems present several potential challenges for 
defenders. First, because they 
have no central authority to carry out legal takedown requests, decentralized 
systems are immune to 
one of the most effective tools in malware defenders' arsenals. Second, some 
decentralized systems 
have high transaction costs to register and manage domains, which renders 
certain existing defender 
strategies less effective. For example, registering all domains that a DGA 
might eventually generate 
is impractical in expensive decentralized naming systems. However, 
decentralized naming systems 
present challenges to malware authors as well, such as how to stealthily access 
the system.

We study the ecosystem and point out several places where defender 
interventions are still possible. 
In particular, we argue that infected hosts must pass through infrastructure 
that is at least 
partially centralized to access any fully decentralized naming system, and 
these centralized or 
partially centralized ``chokepoints'' still present viable points to stage 
interventions. We also 
study five existing decentralized, blockchain-based naming systems, and discuss 
the challenges and 
advantages that each present to malware authors and defenders. We conclude that 
which decentralized 
naming systems present a significant threat, defenders still have viable 
options for enacting C2 
takedowns.
