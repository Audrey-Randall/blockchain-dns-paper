	abstract = {The current landscape of the core Internet technologies shows considerable 
	centralisation with the big tech companies controlling the vast majority of traffic and 
	services. This situation has sparked a wide range of decentralisation initiatives with 
	blockchain technology being among the most prominent and successful innovations. At the same 
	time, over the past years there have been considerable attempts to address the security and 
	privacy issues affecting the Domain Name System (DNS). To this end, it is claimed that 
	Blockchain-based DNS may solve many of the limitations of traditional DNS. However, such an 
	alternative comes with its own security concerns and issues, as any introduction and adoption 
	of a new technology typically does - let alone a disruptive one. In this work we present the 
	emerging threat landscape of blockchain-based DNS and we empirically validate the threats with 
	real-world data. Specifically, we explore a part of the blockchain DNS ecosystem in terms of 
	the browser extensions using such technologies, the chain itself (Namecoin and Emercoin), the 
	domains, and users who have been registered in these platforms. Our findings reveal several 
	potential domain extortion attempts and possible phishing schemes. Finally, we suggest 
	countermeasures to address the identified threats, and we identify emerging research themes.},

	doi = {10.1109/SP.2016.46},
	abstract = {Recently, Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks on web browsing have 
	become easier than they have ever been before because of a problem called 
	"Name Collision" and a protocol called the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) 
	protocol. This name collision attack can cause all web traffic of an 
	Internet user to be redirected to a MitM proxy automatically right after 
	the launching of a standard browser. The underlying problem of this attack 
	is internal namespace WPAD query leakage, which itself is a known problem 
	for years. However, it remains understudied since it was not easily 
	exploitable before the recent new gTLD (generic Top-Level Domains) 
	delegation. In this paper, we focus on this newly-exposed MitM attack 
	vector and perform the first systematic study of the underlying problem 
	causes and its vulnerability status in the wild. First, we show the 
	severity of the problem by characterizing leaked WPAD query traffic to the 
	DNS root servers, and find that a major cause of the leakage problem is 
	actually a result of settings on the end user devices. More specifically, 
	we find that under common settings, devices can mistakenly generate 
	internal queries when used outside an internal network (e.g., used at 
	home). Second, we define and quantify a candidate measure of attack surface 
	by defining "highly-vulnerable domains", which are domains routinely 
	exposing a large number of potential victims, and use it to perform a 
	systematic assessment of the vulnerability status. We find that almost all 
	leaked queries are for new gTLD domains we define to be highly-vulnerable, 
	indirectly validating our attack surface definition. We further find that 
	10\% of these highly-vulnerable domains have already been registered, 
	making the corresponding users immediately vulnerable to the exploit at any 
	time. Our results provide a strong and urgent message to deploy proactive 
	protection. We discuss promising directions for remediation at the new gTLD 
	registry, Autonomous System (AS), and end user levels, and use empirical 
	data analysis to estimate and compare their effectiveness and deployment 
	difficulties.},

	our methodol-ogy for detecting “squatted ” and otherwise inactive domains reveals that among 
	Namecoin’s roughly 120,000 registered domain names, a mere 28 are not squatted and have 
	nontrivial content. Further, we develop techniques for detecting transfers of do-mains in the 
	Namecoin block chain and provide evidence that the market for domains is thin-to-nonexistent. 
	We argue that the state of the art in mecha-nism design for decentralized namespace markets is 
	lacking. We propose a model of utility of differ-ent names to different participants, and 
	articulate desiderata of a decentralized namespace in terms of this utility function. We use

	(C\&C) domains to detect bots and block their trafﬁc. Similar to signature-based virus 
	detection, such a botnet detection approach is static because the blacklist is updated only 
	after running an external (and often manual) process of domain discovery. As a response, 
	botmasters have begun employing domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically produce a 
	large number of random domain names and select a small subset for actual C\&C use. That is, a 
	C\&C domain is randomly generated and used for a very short period of time, thus rendering 
	detection approaches that rely on static domain lists ineffective. Naturally, if we know how a 
	domain generation algorithm works, we can generate the domains ahead of time and still identify 
	and block botnet C\&C trafﬁc. The existing solutions are largely based on reverse engineering 
	of the bot malware executables, which is not always feasible.},
