	abstract = {The current landscape of the core Internet technologies shows considerable 
	centralisation with the big tech companies controlling the vast majority of traffic and 
	services. This situation has sparked a wide range of decentralisation initiatives with 
	blockchain technology being among the most prominent and successful innovations. At the same 
	time, over the past years there have been considerable attempts to address the security and 
	privacy issues affecting the Domain Name System (DNS). To this end, it is claimed that 
	Blockchain-based DNS may solve many of the limitations of traditional DNS. However, such an 
	alternative comes with its own security concerns and issues, as any introduction and adoption 
	of a new technology typically does - let alone a disruptive one. In this work we present the 
	emerging threat landscape of blockchain-based DNS and we empirically validate the threats with 
	real-world data. Specifically, we explore a part of the blockchain DNS ecosystem in terms of 
	the browser extensions using such technologies, the chain itself (Namecoin and Emercoin), the 
	domains, and users who have been registered in these platforms. Our findings reveal several 
	potential domain extortion attempts and possible phishing schemes. Finally, we suggest 
	countermeasures to address the identified threats, and we identify emerging research themes.},

	inﬂuence of one or more command and control (C\&C) servers. The botnet problem reached such 
	levels where federal law enforcement agencies have to step in and take actions against botnets 
	by disrupting (or “taking down”) their C\&Cs, and thus their illicit operations. Lately, more 
	and more private companies have started to independently take action against botnet armies, 
	primarily focusing on their DNS-based C\&Cs. While well-intentioned, their C\&C takedown 
	methodology is in most cases ad-hoc, and limited by the breadth of knowledge available around 
	the malware that facilitates the botnet.},

	(C\&C) domains to detect bots and block their trafﬁc. Similar to signature-based virus 
	detection, such a botnet detection approach is static because the blacklist is updated only 
	after running an external (and often manual) process of domain discovery. As a response, 
	botmasters have begun employing domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically produce a 
	large number of random domain names and select a small subset for actual C\&C use. That is, a 
	C\&C domain is randomly generated and used for a very short period of time, thus rendering 
	detection approaches that rely on static domain lists ineffective. Naturally, if we know how a 
	domain generation algorithm works, we can generate the domains ahead of time and still identify 
	and block botnet C\&C trafﬁc. The existing solutions are largely based on reverse engineering 
	of the bot malware executables, which is not always feasible.},
