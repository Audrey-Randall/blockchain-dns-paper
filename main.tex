%Malware operators require the flexibility to change the 
%location of their C2 servers in response to takedowns, 
%without 
%losing control of infected hosts. This flexibility requires 
%a naming layer.
%
%Malware on infected hosts uses a variety of means to contact 
%its command and control servers. 
%
%To maintain control over infected hosts, malware operators 
%use a variety of means to locate their C2 servers. All of 
%these methods involve a naming layer, to allow for 
%flexibility in changing the C2 server's location in the 
%event 
%of a takedown.

%Malware requires a naming layer to contact its command 
%and control (C2) servers, because infected hosts must have 
%the flexibility to change where they expect the C2 server to 
%be. Until recently, DNS domains were the obvious choice for 
%implementing this naming layer, 
%but DNS domains may be taken down by the registrar that 
%sold them. 

Successful malware campaigns often rely on the ability of 
infected hosts to locate and contact C2 servers. Until 
recently, malware campaigns generally used DNS domains for 
this purpose, but DNS domains may be taken down by the 
registrar that sold them. In response to this threat, malware 
operators have begun using \emph{blockchain-based naming 
systems} to store C2 server names. Blockchain naming systems 
are a 
threat for malware defenders because they are not subject 
to a centralized authority, such as a registrar, that can 
take down abused domains, either voluntarily or under 
legal pressure. In fact, blockchains are robust against a 
variety of interventions that work on DNS domains, which is 
bad news for defenders. 

We analyze the ecosystem of blockchain naming systems and 
identify new locations for defenders to stage interventions 
against malware. In particular, we find that 
malware is obligated to use centralized or 
semi-centralized infrastructure to connect to 
blockchain naming systems and modify the records stored 
within. We also present a study of how blockchain naming 
systems are currently abused by malware operators, and 
discuss the factors that would cause a blockchain naming 
system to become an unstoppable threat. We conclude that
existing blockchain naming systems still provide 
opportunities for defenders to prevent malware from 
contacting its C2 servers.
