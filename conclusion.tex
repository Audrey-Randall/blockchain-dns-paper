\section{Conclusion}

While decentralized naming and hosting systems pose challenges, they cannot 
entirely 
eliminate their reliance on systems with centralized authority. Whenever 
malware uses a centralized 
resource to enable its use of decentralized ones, defenders can intervene. 
Defenders cannot serve 
legal takedown orders to a centralized entity to take 
down a blockchain domain, but they can prevent malware from accessing the 
blockchain in the first 
place, or target the DNS domain or IP address that the blockchain domain 
resolves to. We examined existing blockchain-based naming systems and found 
that naming specific 
blockchains present a threat, but have been well studied, and are susceptible 
to defenses such as 
blocklisting every IP address in the system, blocking the proxies that resolve 
the names, or blocking 
the system entirely, because so little licit 
content exists on those blockchains. We conclude that for a naming system to be 
truly more dangerous 
than DNS, it must achieve widespread adoption as well as inexpensive 
transactions and high 
ease-of-use, and no existing naming systems have yet achieved all three 
characteristics.
